#Collect the Same Number of Minions as Gru

There are four minions.

Each minion has a hidden value. 

By clicking on a minion you add that amount of minions to your collection.

You win the game by collecting the same number of minions as Gru.

You lose the game if your total number of minions is more than Gru. 

Each time the game restarts, the value of each Minion changes as well.
